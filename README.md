# Gulp plugin for Twig (PHP)
 
Plugin for *Gulp* provides integration with Twig original
PHP implementation. Making easy working with true Twig
instead using of the ersatz (**twig-js**) that's has
no actual documentation and active community.

Inspired by **node-twig** (https://github.com/bitmade/node-twig)
that`s contains a good idea, but was't well-working when it was needed (for me).
And still *node-twig* is not a Gulp-plugin as wel as **gulp-twig-php** is not a pure Node.js
extension.

    Composer options in composer.json and middleware file Twig.php
    was took from node-twig package created by Manuel Moritz-Schliesing.
    
    Credentials is untouched.

## What the Twig

The *Twig* (http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is a famous, sustainably growing template engine,
with powerful toolkit over the PHP. Originally, *Twig* intended to working with Symphony2
PHP framework, but more than 6 years history of products made *Twig* more than just a template-engine
extension for framework. Today, *Twig* used by some other frameworks, CMS and more.


## Purpose to use

The *Twig* is a good challenger to be the mainstream of templating, that can
be common for NodeJS and PHP-based engines of HTML-based views development.


## Why not Twig-JS and same?

Same projects are just imitators, that try copy established product,
but prospects of this copy are vague. All attempts to catch up original seems like
Sisyphean Stone lifting, ***and you can't rely on same tools in you projects***.

Particularly, *node-js* refer us to original *Twig* documentation,
but we can't have explain information about tool we use. It s a trap.
In past we tried to use the *node-js*, but documentation was at odds implementation.
And I decide myself to create this tool.
